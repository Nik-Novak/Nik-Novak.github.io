								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to weight loss do you sometimes feel like you have 2 personalities?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fat guy V.S Skinny guy??&nbsp; Like for instance you become skinny guy on Sunday vowing to start the week off right, eat well, go to the gym, you clean out your fridge and rid your home of carbs, sugary snacks and go to bed motivated and ready for the week ahead, determined to see a difference.&nbsp; Monday you are skinny guy&#8230;you eat breakfast consisting of eggs and protein..no toast! Or maybe you blended a green smoothie in an effort to really start this weight loss thing!&nbsp; Your doing great&#8230;day 1 and things are going great. Tuesday you are still skinny guy, you skipped out on meeting friends for dinner and drinks, you ate at home and feel good about your decisions today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we are on Wednesday and fat guy is creeping in&#8230;your craving carbs and sugar of course and you did not prepare lunch today&#8230;fat guy and skinny guy are battling….”go for the salad says skinny guy” Fat guy really wants that sub , loaded with meat and delicious homemade baked bread….its too much for skinny guy to beat and fat guy takes over just 3 days in, now you find yourself devouring the delicious sub you could not refuse….now riddled with guilt you seem to forget skinny guys presence for the last 3 days and continue on with fat guy because its well….easier&#8230;comfortable&#8230;familiar.&nbsp; See weight loss is such a battle in your mind and what keeps one motivated to continue to forget about fat guy and stay with skinny guy.&nbsp; Often we want instant gratification which with weight loss doesn’t happen, it takes time, it takes dedication, and motivation.&nbsp; It’s easy to become depressed and hopeless and just give up before 1 week of eating better.</p>
<p>It’s okay to struggle and its okay to fail but its how you come back from it.&nbsp; If you quit then quit, be happy with your health and your size and move on.&nbsp; However if you are determined and truly want to see a difference in your health and the scale then stick with it.&nbsp; It may take a few months but there is nothing better&nbsp; then slipping on some jeans that you feel good in again or when friends start to notice that you look great and are seeing a difference.&nbsp; Your gaining your life back and confidence and that feels truly amazing!&nbsp; There is no magic to weight loss, its hard work, dedication, and staying focused t meet your goal.&nbsp; Nothing in life is easy and there is no exception to weight loss.&nbsp; Find what makes it fun for you to lose weight such as&nbsp; exercise, cooking healthy meals, walking ,taking the stairs instead of the elevator&#8230;a little work&nbsp; each day into your health goes a long way and if you continue on that path you will find success.&nbsp; Stick with it.!!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who said a healthy breakfast had to be boring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ALMONDS</strong></p>
<p>A handful of almonds packs a serious fat-burning punch: One study of overweight adults found that eating about a quarter-cup of almonds for 6 months led to a 62% greater reduction in weight and BMI. And eating just 1.5 ounces of almonds daily led to a reduction in belly and leg fat, a 2015 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association showed. For added effect, eat almonds before working out: The amino acid L-arginine can help you burn more fat and carbohydrates.</p>
<p><strong>SWEET POTATOES</strong></p>
<p>The vibrant tubers are called super foods for good reason: They’re packed with nutrients and can help you burn fat. Sweet potatoes are high in fiber and have a low glycemic index, which means they’re absorbed slowly and keep you feeling fuller longer. They’re also rich in carotenoids, powerful antioxidants which help stabilize blood sugar levels and lower insulin resistance, which prevents calories from being converted into fat. And their high vitamin profile (including A, C and B6) give you more energy to burn at the gym.</p>
<p><strong>GRAPEFRUIT</strong></p>
<p>The humble grapefruit, a ghost of breakfasts past, deserves its time in the weight-loss spotlight: A study published in the journal Metabolism found that those who ate grapefruit for six weeks lost a full inch off their waistlines. What’s behind the belt-tightening effect? The fruit is rich in phytochemicals, a bioactive compound that burns fat. Talk to your doctor before stocking up on the citrus, though; it can interfere with some medications. These are easy to incorporate into a smoothie or pair with a bowl of oatmeal in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>WILD SALMON</strong></p>
<p>The equation is simple: Protein builds muscle. More muscle = more fat burning. Wild salmon is an excellent place to start, as it’s one of the foods that have been shown to turn off your fat genes. The fish is rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, which fuel fat burning and block fat storage. Adding two servings to your diet each week to get the amount of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids recommended by the American Heart Association. Just be sure always to choose wild salmon; the farmed variety can contain nasty additives,GMO and bad fats.</p>
<p><strong>GREEN TEA</strong></p>
<p>For morning fuel with a fat-burning bonus, replace coffee with green tea. What makes the drink so powerful? It contains catechins, antioxidants that boosts metabolism, speed the release of fat from cells (especially belly fat) and stoke the liver’s fat-burning capacity. Sometimes I brew this and keep it cold to replace the un-sweetend Ice tea, add lemon for sweetness and keeps me hydrated all day!</p>
<p><strong>BERRIES</strong></p>
<p>Raspberries, strawberries and blueberries are a dietary triple threat: They’re a flavorful way to sate sweet cravings, and they’re packed with polyphenols, which can help you burn fat and even stop it from forming. These are easy to incorporate into smoothies, salads, oatmeal, or dairy.</p>
<p><strong>CAYENNE PEPPER</strong></p>
<p>A compound in pepper will leave you with a fire in your belly in more ways than one: Capsaicin has proven to burn belly fat, suppress appetite and boost the body’s ability to convert food to energy. Relax—you don’t have scarf jalapeños raw: You can season grilled fish, meats and eggs with a pinch of red chili pepper.</p>
<p><strong>WHOLE GRAINS</strong></p>
<p>Not all carbs will take up residence around your midsection—in fact, eating whole grains can have the opposite effect. People who ate three or more daily servings of whole grains (such as oats, quinoa and brown rice) had 10% less belly fat than people who ate the same amount of calories from processed white carbs (the white stuff: bread, rice, pasta), according to a Tufts University study. It’s theorized that this is due to whole grains’ high fiber and slow-burn properties. (The phrase “slow carb” is anything but sluggish when it comes to blasting fat.)</p>
<p>All the items are easy to incorporate into your eating routine. You’’ll find the more of these you eat the less of the nutritional deficiency foods you will crave. Not to mention the benefits to your skin, hair and nails. Healthy eating for beauty on the inside and out! I hope you enjoy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because it can trigger some sense of reward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>FEELING #1: YOU’RE LONELY</h2>
<h3>Because It: Messes Up Your Hunger Hormones</h3>
<p>Any bad mood can lead us to try to comfort ourselves with food, and loneliness is about as bad a feeling as you can have. But the link between loneliness and weight gain is more substantial than that. A new study in the journal Hormones and Behavior found that those who feel lonely experience greater circulating levels of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin after they eat, causing them to feel hungrier sooner. Over time, folks who are lonely simply take in more calories than those with stronger social support networks.</p>
<p>Break the Mood: Remember that the best way to stick to a healthy diet and exercise routine is to do it with someone else. So, partner up—with a friend or a personal trainer. Set aside a special outfit you want to wear and set a goal!</p>
<h2>FEELING #2: YOU’RE HAPPILY MARRIED</h2>
<h3>Because It Makes Us Copy Our Partner’s Bad Habits</h3>
<p>A review of more than 600 studies found that being married, and transitioning into marriage, are both associated with weight gain. The researchers says that’s because of the increased opportunities for eating due to shared, regular meals and larger portion sizes, as well as “decreased physical activity and a decline in weight maintenance for the purpose of attracting an intimate partner.” That’s science speak for&#8230;you let yourself go!<br />Break the Mood: Identify the shared habits that are harming your health. And try to cook healthy meals together.</p>
<h2>FEELING #3: YOU’RE DEPRIVED</h2>
<h3>Because It Manifests Itself as Hunger</h3>
<p>Food. Sex. Adventure. Validation. If you feel like you, or someone else, is depriving yourself of something, then you are more likely to overeat, regardless of how “good” you want to be. And if it’s food you’re trying to resist, you’ll also experience more cravings for whatever it is you aren’t getting, according to a study in the International Journal of Eating Disorders. Our brains actually become wired to view forbidden foods as rewards, setting us up for cravings that are hard to satisfy. This, my friends, is why most diets fail. You can only resist chocolate cake for so long before you find yourself at the diner, wolfing down a couple of slices.<br />Break the Mood: If you’re feeling deprived by your diet, build in a Cheat Meal at least once a week in which you can indulge guilt-free. Doing this will help you avoid viewing certain foods as “off limits,” which will help you crave them less. This is why cheat day is important and should be part of your weekly menu, pick one day and enjoy what you love. You’ll find yourself slowly getting away from so many unhealthy choices and only indulge in a cheat meal rather than the entire day!</p>
<h2>FEELING #4: YOU’RE ANXIOUS</h2>
<p>When you’re anxious, feels like it’s under a tremendous amount of stress all the time. This is why anxiety is a powerful trigger for weight gain. A recent study in the journal Eating and Weight Disorders placed anxiety as “one of the most important factors significantly associated with weight gain.” In fact, two-thirds of people with eating disorders also suffer from anxiety, and the anxiety usually existed first.</p>
<p>Break the Mood: Soothe yourself with some weight-loss tea. Pu-erh, a fermented Chinese tea, can literally shrink the size of your fat cells, according to new research. Also get some activity, maybe a walk, a run to get the blood flow going and it can change your mood dramatically.</p>
<h2>Feeling #5 Stress</h2>
<h3>Because It: Triggers Fat Storage</h3>
<p>When stress hits, the first thing your body does is to up its production of adrenaline. Adrenaline causes fat cells all over your body to squirt their stores of fatty acids into your bloodstream, where they can be used as energy. This was great back when stress meant a charging saber-toothed tiger or an attacking horde of barbarians, and you could turn and head for the hills. But you can’t really run away from a deadline or take up arms against a traffic jam. All you can do is bear down and, to help soothe your nerves, maybe have a snack. And another. Meanwhile, a second hormone called cortisol grabs all those unused fatty acids from your bloodstream and stores them in your belly region. With that fat stored, not burned, your body goes looking for more calories to replace the fatty acids it released earlier (back when it thought the hordes were invading). That being said, if you&#8217;re looking for something to munch on about three hours after your last meal, you&#8217;re probably hungry and stressed; rely on these weight loss snacks to get you through.</p>
<p>Break the Mood: Laughter is the best stress reliever. It lowers your heart rate, improves your mood, makes you friendlier, and decreases anxiety. So go see a comedy,gather with friends who make you feel good. Also try yoga or an exercise that helps reduce stress. We all have some form of stress but how we channel that energy can dramatically change the outcome! Remember stay focused and remember why you started the weight loss journey in the beginning.</p>
<h2>FEELING #6: BOREDOM</h2>
<h3>Because It: Confuses Your Brain</h3>
<p>When you’re bored you actually lose your ability to make smart food choices; you become an “emotional eater,” according to a new study in the Journal of Health Psychology. boredom turns you into the worse kind of emotional eater, because you not only make the wrong food choices, you eat much more of those fattening foods than you normally would. Unfortunately for us, “Because I’m Bored” is one of the top reasons people give when they’re asked about their emotions before they eat.<br />Break the Mood: You feel bored when you are dissatisfied, restless, and unchallenged, according to a study in Frontiers in Psychology. The best way to beat boredom is to find something to do that is purposeful and challenging. When your bored get some exercise or find a hobby that motivates you.</p>
<h2>FEELING #7: Sadness</h2>
<h3>Because it: can trigger all kinds or actions</h3>
<p>We all get sad one time or another, maybe you’ve experienced a death of a loved one, loss of a job, or loss of friendship. This can drive you to take it out with your diet. Those sweets and unhealthy foods will not feed the void your experiencing.</p>
<p>BREAK THE MOOD: Challenge yourself regularly to find meaningful habits in your life, exchange that for a food that will only give you back a limited feeling and leave you unsatisfied and feeling guilty.</p>
<h2>FEELING #8 HAPPINESS</h2>
<h3>Because it can trigger some sense of reward</h3>
<p>Break the Mood: Change the way you look at food as a reward, sometimes we feel entitled to a sweet treat because we want to reward ourselves with a deadline met, a good grade, or maybe you’ve just lost 5 lbs and feel you deserve that chocolate cake and ice cream. I’m not saying you can never reward yourself with something sweet but maybe make a different choice for a reward, a new outfit, a book, a little weekend getaway.</p>
<p>Weight Loss is a daily choice. Weight Loss takes time, it takes strength, and takes motivation. Nothing comes easy in life, Maybe its your degree in education, that work project that excelled your career, the job you finally landed. All these things took hard work and were about choices along the way and making good decisions. Apply that to your life when it comes to your weight loss goals and eating habits and you’ll be amazed at what you can achieve! REMEMBER NEVER GIVE UP!</p>
<p>Feel Free to send in your weight loss achievements, or useful tips that you want to share and encourage others with and I will post to the web page.<br />All the best in your weight loss journey!<br />Sincerely,<br />The jump6 Team</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lose Weight Without Starving</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Lose Weight Without Starving</strong></p>
<p>The Chia Seed is a dieter’s dream come true. The tiny, healthy seeds can be made to taste like whatever you want, and their unique gelling action keeps you feeling full for hours. Hunger is a main enemy of real weight loss, and you don’t want to fight it with jittery expensive pills. When a chia seed is exposed to water, it forms a coating of gel, increasing its size and weight. Since the gel made of water, it has no calories. It’s also difficult to remove from the seed, meaning that it helps your body think it is full, without adding calories!</p>
<p><strong>2. Balance Blood Sugar</strong></p>
<p>Keeping balanced levels of blood sugar is important for both health and energy. Blood sugar may spike after meals, especially if you eat high-starchy foods or sweets. This can lead to ‘slumps’ in your day where you feel tired and out of energy. By balancing your blood sugar, you not only lower your risk for type 2 diabetes, but you also ensure steady, constant energy throughout your day. But how does the Chia Seed help with this? Both the gelling action of the seed, and it’s unique combination of soluble and insoluble fiber combine to slow down your body’s conversion of starches into sugars. If you eat chia with a meal, it will help you turn your food into constant, steady energy rather than a series of ups and downs that wear you out</p>
<p><strong>3. Help Prevent Diverticulitis </strong></p>
<p>With the abundance of over-processed foods and white flour on the market today, rich sources of fiber are harder to come by. These foods of convenience have contributed to the rise of diverticulitis. Irregularity is a big factor in this risky condition. To help ensure regularity, you need plenty of soluble and insoluble fiber in your diet. If you don’t want to eat celery, and whole-grain everything…or piles of bran flakes, the Chia Seed is here to help. Each seed is coated with soluble fibers which aid its gelling action. The exterior of the seed is protected by insoluble fiber. The insoluble fiber is unable to be digested (it does not contribute any calories, or break down) so instead, it helps keep food moving smoothly through the digestive process. Soluble fiber, and the gel coating of the seed keeps the colon hydrated and ensures the easy movement of food.</p>
<p><strong>4. Add healthy omega-3 oil to your diet </strong></p>
<p>Omega-3 oil is usually thought of as “that healthy stuff in fish”. But, what if you don’t want to eat fish every day? What if you’re a vegetarian, or simply worried about pollution adding harmful substances to your fish dinner? Chia is the richest plant-source of this healthy oil. By weight, chia contains more omega 3 than salmon, and it still tastes like whatever you want! Omega 3 oil is important in heart and cholesterol health. It’s also recently been targeted as a weight-loss helper. USA Weekend magazine also reports on a study where overweight dieters who included omega 3s in their eating plan lost 2 more pounds monthly than the control group, who did not.</p>
<p><strong>5. Feel more energized all day long </strong></p>
<p>Don’t want to feel like taking an afternoon nap? Your energy levels have a lot to do with what you eat. Chia is one of nature’s highest plant-based sources of complete protein. Usually protein from items like peanut butter and some beans are incomplete, meaning you have to combine them with other foods to get the full benefit. Not Chia though, it’s protein is complete to raise your energy levels. The combination of complete protein, vitamins, minerals and blood-sugar balancing gel all work together to make sure you have steady, never jittery energy.</p>
<p><strong>6. Bake with less fat </strong></p>
<p>Do you enjoy making baked goods at home, but hate all the butter and oil that has to go into them? Chia gel can substitute for half the butter in most recipes! The food will bake the same and taste the same (or better) from the addition of the chia gel. All you need to do is divide the amount of butter or oil in half, and then use the same amount of chia gel to fill in. The anti-oxidants in chia can even help keep the food tasting fresh longer. Everything from cookies to cakes to muffins, pancakes and waffles can be made with chia gel as your butter replacement. Which recipe will become your new favorite?</p>
<p><strong>7. Add age-defying anti-oxidants </strong></p>
<p>Anti-oxidants have been in the news lately due to their super healthy benefits. You know that blueberries and several exotic fruits (that aren’t always in season) have them, but did you know that chia is extremely high in anti-oxidants too? These helpful substances are what makes the Chia Seed stay fresh for so long. At room temperature, they’ll stay fresh and ready to eat for over two whole years! And that’s all without a single chemical or preservative. This amazing ability is not found in other seeds like flax or sesame, because those seeds don’t have the same rich anti-oxidant content. Anti-oxidants help prevent free-radical damage in your body. Free radicals lead to problematic conditions such as premature aging of the skin and inflammation of various tissues. Fight free radical damage by staying fresh and healthy with nature’s anti-oxidant powerhouse.</p>
<p><strong>8. Cut cravings for food </strong></p>
<p>Being deficient in minerals or vitamins can create a craving for food. For example, if you’re low on calcium, you may feel compelled to eat lots of cheese and ice cream. This happens because your body knows that cheese is a source of calcium, and it hasn’t been getting enough. But what if dairy and whole milk are a “Diet don’t”? You can always add calcium to your food by sprinkling on the chia. By weight, chia has more calcium than whole milk. It also has magnesium and boron, essential trace minerals used in the absorption of calcium and other vitamins. By balancing your vitamins and minerals with chia, you can curb cravings that might tempt you.</p>
<p><strong>9. You can pack in more flavorful punch </strong></p>
<p>How can a seed with NO flavor help the foods you already like to love taste better? First, because they have no taste of their own, chia seeds will never cover up or add to the flavor of your food. Second, when the seeds hydrate, they magnify the taste of whatever they were added to. Put them in pudding? Chocolaty! Swirl them into a smoothie? Fruity! The same thing goes with dressings, dips, salsas, sauces and more. These two factors combine to let chia seeds take on the taste of whatever you add them to. They distribute and never dilute, the flavors you love.</p>
<p><strong>10. Save your money </strong></p>
<p>Why should eating less cost you more? You already know diet pills are expensive, and ‘box meal plans’ can run up to $500.00 a month. If you’re buying ‘calorie counting packs’ or other individual portions in the store, you can also end up paying more because more preparation and materials go into these foods. More than enough chia for 1 month costs less than a dollar a day. You can use as much or as little as you want to achieve your own desired results. There are no preparations required for these simple seeds. They’re always safe and 100% chemical free. A measuring spoon is all you’ll need when you’re ready to take advantage of chia for yourself. It doesn’t get any easier or more inexpensive</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When eating out at a restaurant the choices can be endless and may difficult to navigate through the danger zones, eating what you love, and staying healthy. Below is a few tips to help you through those impromptu dinner meeting, dinner with family or friends, or the option when you haven’t prepared anything at home….it’s okay, it happens!</p>
<p><strong>Dining Out</strong></p>
<p>Going out to dinner tonight? You&#8217;ve got plenty of company. Almost 75 percent of us eat at a restaurant at least once a week, and 25 percent dine out every two or three days, according to a study by the USDA. And hey, why not? Letting someone else cook is relaxing — the perfect treat after a busy day. Trouble is, a recent study at the University of Texas found that female dieters consume an extra 253 calories and 16 fat grams on the days that they eat at restaurants. Portion sizes have increased in recent years — and most of us tend to polish off every bite. No matter how big the serving size you canhappily order off any menu and drop pounds — or maintain a healthy weight — without depriving yourself. Just follow the easy, carry-it-with-you guide.</p>
<p><strong>Healthy Eating Tips</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve booked a big dinner, so you skip lunch. Sound familiar? Don&#8217;t. By the time you arrive at the restaurant you&#8217;re famished, and hello — here&#8217;s the bread basket! Two or three pieces later (with butter, of course), you&#8217;ve inhaled a couple hundred calories — and you haven&#8217;t even spoken to the waiter.<br />From now on, ditch the starve-yourself-all-day routine. Instead, eat a light lunch, such as a salad with chicken and veggies and a whole-grain roll. Then in the late afternoon, have a small snack — a container of low-fat yogurt, a handful of almonds (about one ounce), or a cube of low-fat cheese. Keeping your hunger under control means you won&#8217;t dive into the bread basket the moment you&#8217;re shown to your table.</p>
<p><strong>Go easy on the wine.</strong></p>
<p>If you want a glass of pinot noir, by all means have it. Just don&#8217;t go overboard. One study found that women who indulged in more than two drinks a day consumed nearly 30 percent more calories. Stick to one glass of wine — which is what the American Medical Association advises as best for your health.<br />Beware of dishes labeled &#8220;light.&#8221;</p>
<p>More and more restaurants are promoting low-cal, good-for-you choices — and we love that! — but unfortunately, the claim isn&#8217;t always true. Case in point: One so-called healthy dish we recently saw on a chain-restaurant menu was a large steak covered with gorgonzola cheese, and vegetables cooked in butter. The waitress explained that it qualified as a &#8220;spa&#8221; selection because it was low in carbs. Yes, but it was loaded with artery-clogging saturated fat and calories! Read the menu carefully. Look for a balance of lean protein (fish, chicken breast, pork tenderloin, strip steak), complex carbohydrates (brown rice, whole wheat pasta) and monounsaturated fats (canola or olive oil). If you want more information to help you choose the healthiest meals, go to the restaurant&#8217;s Web site ahead of time to see if they list nutritional information for each dish.</p>
<p><strong>Practice portion control.</strong></p>
<p>Eat three-quarters of what&#8217;s on your plate and then stop. According to James Hill, PhD, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Colorado, this one simple step can easily shave up to 300 calories off your meal. What&#8217;s more, you&#8217;ll be so satisfied from eating 75 percent of your dinner that you&#8217;ll barely miss those extra few bites.</p>
<p><strong>Be smart about salad.</strong></p>
<p>At the salad bar, fill your plate with veggies, greens, chickpeas, and edamame, and top it with one or two tablespoons of low-fat dressing. Limit the bacon bits, cheese, croutons, and creamy dressings — or skip them entirely. Ditto for pasta, tuna, or chicken salads swimming in mayo. If you can&#8217;t resist, serve yourself just a quarter-cup serving.</p>
<p><strong>Pick the best protein.</strong></p>
<p>Gotta have a steak? A 10-ounce rib-eye can pack 780 calories or more. Instead, order leaner cuts of beef, such as tenderloin, flank steak, or strip. The recommended serving size is approximately 5 ounces (about the size of the palm of your hand). If the restaurant doesn&#8217;t offer one that small, cut your portion in half and take the rest home.</p>
<h3><strong>More Healthy Eating Tips</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask.</strong></p>
<p>Restaurants will honor all kinds of special requests — all you have to do is speak up. Order your food grilled, baked, broiled, poached, or steamed instead of fried. Ask for dishes to be cooked with a little olive oil instead of butter. Request extra veggies — and less pasta — in your pasta primavera.</p>
<p><strong>Get more for less.</strong></p>
<p>So many people get stuck on the notion that they have to eat an entree. Says who? Order two appetizers instead and you&#8217;ll sample twice the food but eat less overall. Or have one appetizer and share a main course with a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Make healthy swaps.</strong></p>
<p>Choose whole grains such as brown rice or whole-grain bread over refined white bread and rice. Pass up the French fries and the cheese-stuffed potato and order two vegetables, steamed, or a salad and vegetables. Instead of creamy pasta dishes, opt for those with tomato sauces, which are generally lower in fat and calories.</p>
<p><strong>Eat dessert.</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re not kidding. Try to deny yourself the chocolate souffle that sounds so scrumptious and you just might chow down on something worse — like an entire carton of ice cream — when you get home. The smart girl&#8217;s strategy: Order one dessert for the table. A few bites should satisfy your sweet tooth. Not in the mood to share? Ask for a dish of berries or a small fruit sorbet.</p>
<h3><strong>Smart Choices</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Make Smart Choices at Your Favorite Restaurants</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fast food<br /></strong>Choose: Grilled chicken or fish. Ask for the sauce separately and use just one tablespoon. Instead of fries, order a green salad with the dressing on the side.</p>
<p>Not: Deep-fried foods. There are so many other healthy choices now!</p>
<p><strong>Coffee bar</strong><br />Choose: An 8-ounce coffee with milk; 11 calories<br />Not: A 20-ounce latte; 340 calories</p>
<p><strong>Mexican</strong><br />Choose: Fajitas made with grilled meats and vegetables, burritos or enchiladas filled with chicken, shrimp, or lean meat and a small amount of cheese<br />Not: Dishes smothered with cheese, fried chimichangas, refried beans, large bowls of tortilla chips (a few with salsa is fine), pitchers of margaritas (limit yourself to one for 170 calories)</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong><br />Choose: Sushi made with shrimp, tuna, tofu, or vegetables, sashimi, miso soup, teppanyaki dishes (meat, fish, or vegetables cooked on an iron griddle)</p>
<p>Not: Tempura, large platters of sushi rolls (each can be 250 calories or more, and you can easily eat two or three), teriyaki (the sauce can contain a lot of sugar)</p>
<p><strong>Chinese</strong><br />Choose: Stir-fried shrimp, chicken and vegetables, steamed brown rice</p>
<p>Not: Dishes with thick sweet-and-sour sauces like Kung Pao chicken, large bowls of rice, fried egg rolls, lo mein, breaded or deep-fried foods such as orange beef<br />Indian</p>
<p>Choose: Tandoori chicken or other foods cooked in a tandoor oven; look for &#8220;tikka&#8221; or &#8220;bhuna&#8221; dishes, which aren&#8217;t covered with heavy sauces</p>
<p>Not: Dishes that come with creamy sauces, naan (Indian breads that are often stuffed with potatoes or coconut and topped with butter), deep-fried samosas<br />Italian</p>
<p>Choose: Vegetable or seafood antipasto, minestrone soup, fish or chicken dishes served with vegetables, grilled meats</p>
<p>Not: Deep-fried and breaded foods such as veal or eggplant parmesan, creamy sauces such as fettuccine Alfredo, dishes stuffed with cheese such as manicotti and calzones</p>
<h3><strong>Calorie Intake</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How Many Calories Should You Eat?</strong><br />It depends. If you&#8217;re trying to lose weight, aim for about 1,400 to 1,500 a day. To maintain your weight, consume about 2,000 calories if you&#8217;re moderately active — which works out to about 500 calories per meal, plus two small snacks. Don&#8217;t skip meals — eating regularly keeps your metabolism humming. And try to exercise at least 20 to 30 minutes a day. (For great 20-minute workout ideas, check out Editor-in-Chief Denise Brodey&#8217;s 20-minute miracle blog.) It doesn&#8217;t have to be all at once; little bursts of activity count. So take the stairs instead of the elevator at work, and go for a 15-minute walk at lunch. To find out exactly how many calories you need, check out our caloric needs calculator. To determine what your portion sizes should be,.</p>
<p>Weight loss is a constant day to day struggle for some so some tips to help you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set Goals</li>
<li>Stay Focused….make good decisions and think about how you feel when you eat unhealthy food and think about how you feel when you eat better and your clothes start to feel and look better.</li>
<li>Take time for you, prepare meals, get out for a walk, you don’t need an hour at the gym but simply 20 min of some form of activity</li>
<li>Never Give Up!!</li>

<p>Genetic modification is the process of forcing genes from one species into another entirely unrelated species.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism. Other names for the process include Genetic Engineering (GE) or Genetic Modification (GM), which are one and the same.</p>
<p>How is a GMO Different from Hybridization / Cross-Breeding?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Genetic modification is the process of forcing genes from one species into another entirely unrelated species. Unlike cross breeding or hybridization—both of which involve two related species and have been done without ill effects for centuries—genetic engineering forcefully breaches the naturally-occuring barriers between species.<br />Example: Corn + DNA from soil bacteria that is naturally immune to RoundUp herbicide + e.coli bacteria + soil bacteria that causes tumors in plants (which enables the plant’s cell wall to be breached) = RoundUp Ready Corn (one of several RoundUp Ready crops engineered by Monsanto).</p>
<p>Other examples of GMOs include strawberries and tomatoes injected with fish genes to protect the fruit from freezing, goats injected with spider genes to produce milk with proteins stronger than kevlar for use in industrial products, salmon that are genetically engineered with a growth hormone that allow them to keep growing larger, dairy cows injected with the genetically engineered hormone rBGH (also known as rBST) to increase milk production, and rice injected with human genes to produce pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>More and More companies are now labeling their foods so that you the consumer can make a choice</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about what your putting into your body and how it effects weight gain and increased health risks, the link provided will provide you some useful information. The more we know the more we understand and the better we can make healthier choices!</p>
