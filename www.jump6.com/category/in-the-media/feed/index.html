								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By RONI CARYN RABIN</h4>
<p>Tammy Kwarciak, a 44-year-old nurse whose weight had been creeping up for years, was determined to lose 50 pounds. So in February, she drove from her home in Port Huron, Mich., across the border into Canada and had a small balloonlike device inserted into her stomach.</p>
<p>The intragastric balloon, filled with liquid and left in the stomach for up to six months, is not approved for use in the United States, though it&rsquo;s available in Europe, South America and other parts of the world. Clinical trials required to win federal Food and Drug Administration approval are being initiated, but many Americans aren&rsquo;t waiting.</p>
<p>Since the balloon&rsquo;s introduction in Canada in 2006, people like Mrs. Kwarciak have been streaming north in growing numbers. Drawn by the relative ease of balloon placement, Americans account for nearly a third of patients undergoing the procedures in Canadian clinics just over the border.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nice thing about the balloon is that you have such a sense of satiety,&rdquo; said Mrs. Kwarciak, who has lost 25 pounds since she had the procedure. &ldquo;I feel full all the time. I have to remind myself at times to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the balloon is a temporary measure, and once it is removed in a few months, she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intragastric balloon appeals to people like Mrs. Kwarciak who have a significant amount of weight to lose but are not heavy enough to qualify for bariatric surgery like gastric bypass surgery and adjustable gastric band surgery. The patient is anesthetized, and the balloon is inserted through the esophagus &mdash; a relatively noninvasive procedure. It is removed after six months or so.</p>
<p>The balloon may also be an option for extremely obese people who need to lose enough weight to be considered for more invasive procedures.</p>
<p>But just because the placement doesn&rsquo;t involve surgery doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s risk-free. Patients can suffer severe nausea and vomiting during the first few days or week after placement. On rare occasions, it can deflate and obstruct the intestines, or it can perforate the abdomen, which can be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Perhaps as significant, the weight loss that patients can expect is modest at best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most common complication &mdash; not losing as much weight as the patient would like,&rdquo; said Dr. Sanjeev Kaila, the plastic surgeon who pioneered the intragastric balloon program in Canada. Some return for a second balloon after taking a short break, he added.</p>
<p>Though Mrs. Kwarciak said she lost 25 pounds in the first two months, studies say most patients experience the bulk of their weight loss during the first three to four months after the balloon&rsquo;s insertion.</p>
<p>Studies of the balloon have reported weight loss ranging from 13 to 34 pounds on average, with some individuals losing up to 50 pounds. Patients often gain weight again after the device is removed, though long-term studies are limited.</p>
<p>For more information or to find a clinic please call a Jump6 patient care coordinator at 647-667-7473 or 1-866-375-2452&nbsp;or go on line</p>

<p>Carole Rondeau, 44, knew her son, Ryan, wanted to lose 72 pounds.&nbsp; They tried everything, but never had any luck.&nbsp; So Carole did research and came upon Jump6&trade; Weight Loss Program, which features a water-filled gastric balloon. The procedure is non-surgical; essentially, patients have a soft silicone intragastric balloon, in deflated form, inserted into the stomach through their mouth. Once in place, the balloon is inflated, also through the mouth, with sterile water via a self-sealing valve. The balloon remains there for up to six months, encouraging portion control by providing an early and prolonged feeling of fullness after meals.</p>

<p><strong>Abbreviated Transcript of Interview with Dr. S. Kaila</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eric Michaels</strong>: What is the Jump6 program featuring the intragastric balloon?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaila</strong>: This is a very unique weight loss program that&#8217;s different than anything else out there right now. It&#8217;s not a diet and it&#8217;s not surgery &#8211; it&#8217;s kind of in between both&#8230;it allows people to lose 40 pounds in 6 months without having surgery and without all the risk of surgery&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Eric Michaels</strong>: How is this different from other procedures like the gastric band?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaila</strong>: Very different. It is not a surgical procedure and you will not have to be put to sleep and does not involve cutting&#8230;gastric band and by pass have potential problems in a sense that you can have complications that are fairly significant &#8211; especially with the by pass&#8230;with the balloon, it really isn&#8217;t a surgery &#8211; what we are doing is sliding a balloon into your stomach and filling it up with water &#8211; without cutting this is a very big plus for any patient and is attractive&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Eric Michaels</strong>: Who is the best candidate for the procedure?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaila</strong>: The balloon is indicated for anyone that has a BMI of 25 or more and that would classify anyone that is overweight &#8211; so if you look at the statistics &#8211; 59% of people in Canada fall under the overweight category with a BMI of 25 or more. In the United States it is actually higher &#8211; so there are a large amount of candidates for this procedure&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Globe and Mail</p>
<p>Kyriaki Antoniou of Chatham, Ontario recently underwent a new weight loss procedure which inserts a balloon into the stomach. Since the procedure a month ago she has lost over 20 pounds. (GEOFF ROBINS/Geoff Robins/The Globe and Mail)</p>
<p>It was her daughter&#8217;s recent wedding photos that did it. Kyriaki Antoniou had tried everything to lose weight over the years, including spending more than $5,000 on Jenny Craig, but she kept losing and regaining the same 30 or 45 pounds. She couldn&#8217;t stand to look at herself in those photos.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so depressed,&#8221; says the Chatham, Ont.-based 49-year-old.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t help that her family business is running a pizzeria.</p>
<p>So when Ms. Antoniou saw a magazine ad about a new gastric balloon procedure, she took it to her family doctor immediately. The $8,000 treatment, offered under the Canadian brand name Jump6, involves the insertion of a gastric balloon into the stomach via a tube through the esophagus. The balloon is then inflated with water and left in place for six months. The theory: Because the balloon takes up stomach space, patients feel full and eat less.</p>
<p>Ms. Antoniou&#8217;s doctor gave her the okay, since the procedure was less invasive than others, such as gastric bypass surgery. It also involved lifestyle consulting for a full year.</p>
<p>After three weeks, she has lost more than 16 pounds from her 204-pound frame.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel fantastic,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;m not hungry because my stomach is full. And I have back-up support.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sanjeev Kaila, the Sarnia plastic surgeon who consulted with Ms. Antoniou in advance of her procedure, and the medical director for the whole Jump6 program, says the new balloon offers some of the benefits of more invasive weight-loss operations, but with the added boost of access to a dietitian, a physical trainer and a psychologist. Patients lose an average of about 40 pounds, he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The balloon is like a cast,&#8221; he says. &#8220;A cast takes pressure off the bone so it can heal. The balloon fills you up so you feel full, allowing your body and mind to redo themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, obesity experts say that without a serious lifestyle makeover, gastric balloon patients have been shown to gain the weight back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Success hinges on the willpower of the individual and whether they can make the transition to more permanent habit changes over that six months,&#8221; says diabetes and obesity expert David Lau, a physician and professor of medicine at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>Robert Dent, who performs bariatric surgery as the medical director of the Ottawa Hospital Bariatric Centre of Excellence, says there is little scientific evidence that the gastric balloon will result in long-term success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it better than Weight Watchers? Maybe,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But we don&#8217;t know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, on the face of it, Dr. Dent says, offering a tamer version of more severe gastric surgery combined with the lifestyle counselling may be a good combination.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gives them the skills for keeping it off and gives them the encouragement by using a little surgical assist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The balloon, trademarked the Orbera and manufactured by U.S.-based Allergan, which makes medical products ranging from breast implants to Botox, was approved by Health Canada in 2006. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved it, so about 20 per cent of the business at the four Ontario clinics offering the procedure is from the United States, according to Mario Cortis, the CEO of Canadian Gastric Ballooning Inc., which distributes the balloon under the Jump6 brand.</p>
<p>Experts such as Dr. Lau say that gastric procedures are becoming important tools for treating many of the chronic conditions associated with obesity, including diabetes and high blood pressure. Some restrict the size of the stomach and others alter the way the digestive system absorbs calories and nutrients.</p>
<p>Costs range from about $15,000 for a procedure that squeezes the stomach with a band to $25,000 for the gold-standard procedure called the Roux-en-Y bypass, which reduces the size of the stomach and rearranges the small intestine. It is the only gastric surgery covered by provincial health plans.</p>
<p>These procedures are currently considered for people with a body mass index over 40, or over 35 if they have additional conditions such as diabetes.</p>
<p>The Orbera gastric balloon, however, is recommended for a wider range of patients, starting with those considered merely overweight, with a BMI of 27 or higher.</p>
<p>A recent Canadian Institute for Health Information survey reported a 92-per-cent increase in bariatric procedures performed in Canadian hospitals between 2004/2005 and 2008/2009 &#8211; which added up to 2,385 procedures in total. Women are 80 per cent of the patients and their average age is 43.</p>
<p>As obesity rates continue to rise in Canada, the demand will likely increase, too. About 400 people have gone through the Jump6 program in 2 1/2 years, and the clinics are currently performing 40 to 50 procedures a month.</p>
<p>
  Ms. Antoniou is ecstatic about how the balloon has jump-started her own weight loss. She plans to shed about 45 pounds and be well on her way to keeping it off by her 50th birthday next May.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has changed my whole life,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to give up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jump6- Sticking to a weight-loss program is easier when you feel full after a few bites, says a local clinic.<br />
  It also helps when there&rsquo;s the support of a counsellor, dietician and personal trainer available.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the concept behind the Jump6 Program now being offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve researched the literature on the Jump6 gastric balloon program, and we&#8217;re confident that it is both effective and safe in combating obesity, especially when the target weight loss is between 20 to 60 pounds,&#8221; said Dr. Emad Guirguis.</p>
<p>The 10-minute procedure has doctors inserting a balloon into the patient&rsquo;s stomach through the mouth and filling it with sterile water, which is coloured to provide a heads-up in the unlikely case of leakage.</p>
<p>Patients feel full, eat less and, in turn, lose weight, according to program founder Mario Cortis, CEO of Canadian Gastric Balloon Inc. (CGBI), who is currently enrolled in the</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working long hours, I tend to forget to eat properly and miss out on exercising on a regular basis,&rdquo; he blogged. &ldquo;So I thought&mdash;why not try what our patients are experiencing, and lose the weight at the same time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The balloon is intended to stay in place for six months and be complemented with diet, exercise and psychological support, which continues for an additional six months.</p>
<p>The clinic won&rsquo;t put a balloon in unless a person is making a commitment to see a nutritionist during the six months. Gastric balloons are already being used across Europe, South America and Australia, according to CGBI, which is the only entity to offer the procedure in Canada.</p>
<p>To qualify for theJump6 program, please call 647-667-7473 or 1-866-375-2452&nbsp;or request a consultation on line and patient care co coordinator will be in touch.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Windsor Star</p>
<p>By Sonja Puzic, The Windsor Star May 10, 2010&nbsp;&nbsp; WINDSOR, Ont. &#8212; Windsor-area residents struggling to shed excess weight will soon have another option that doesn&#8217;t involve stomach surgery or extreme dieting.</p>
<p>All it takes is a grapefruit-sized balloon and 10 or 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Dr. Sanjeev Kaila, a plastic surgeon who runs an innovative weight loss program for the jump6 weight loss&nbsp; is bringing the intragastric balloon procedure to help individuals achieve their weight loss goals.</p>
<p>The balloon was approved in Canada recently. The procedure is simple: A deflated silicone balloon is inserted into the sedated patient&#8217;s stomach through the mouth and down the throat, then filled with sterile water.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you wake up, you feel like you&#8217;ve eaten 10 Thanksgiving dinners. You don&#8217;t feel interested in eating,&#8221; Kaila said in an interview.</p>
<p>Unlike gastric bypass surgery, where the stomach is surgically divided and the small intestine rearranged, the balloon procedure is &#8220;very low risk,&#8221; Kaila said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no cutting, no bleeding, no risk of infection. It&#8217;s a pretty natural process,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The only real side-effect is nausea.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a risk of the balloon tearing inside the stomach, but Kaila said that hasn&#8217;t happened to any of his clients.</p>
<p>The balloon remains in the stomach for six months, leaving less space for food and keeping hunger at bay.</p>
<p>Kaila, who doesn&#8217;t perform the procedure himself but works with a network of general surgeons, said the average weight loss among his clients is between 40 and 60 pounds in six months.</p>
<p>&#8220;You lose a significant amount of weight because you always feel full,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you&#8217;re on a diet, you&#8217;re always hungry, you&#8217;re stressed and you have that gnawing at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The balloon method is also very discreet, Kaila said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have the balloon put in, go back to work and &#8230; no one will even know.&#8221;</p>
<p>After six months, it&#8217;s deflated, then removed &#8212; under sedation &#8212; the way it went in.</p>
<p>Kaila, who appeared on the popular U.S. TV show The Doctors Thursday to talk about intragastric balloons, said his centre has performed about 120 balloon procedures in the past eight months.</p>
<p>Many patients travelled to Sarnia from Windsor-Essex. Kaila said some people came from as far away as California, since the procedure is not yet approved in the U.S.</p>
<p>Demand from Windsor-area residents led Kaila to team up with two local surgeons to perform the procedure here.</p>
<p>A local clinic should be set up within the next month or so, Kaila said.</p>
<p>So far, Kaila said he&#8217;s seen a success rate of more than 90 per cent.</p>
<p>He said followup studies show that people who&#8217;ve undergone the balloon procedure regain only five per cent of the weight after two years, while dieters regain about 95 per cent of the weight.</p>
<p>While the balloons can be inserted in people who are considered morbidly obese, Kaila said his ideal client is more of an &#8220;average person who&#8217;s got those 20, 30, 40 extra pounds they can&#8217;t rid of&#8221; &#8212; people who&#8217;ve tried everything from traditional exercise and</p>
<p>diet routines to herbal pills and weight management programs with no luck.</p>
<p>The procedure is not covered by OHIP and Dr. Kaila said there are financing options for about $200 a month.</p>
