								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all been there, as we end another year and look excitedly to one ahead , we reflect a little. How was this past year lived? With disappointment? Achievements? Goals met? Goals made, ?its easy to beat ourselves up on things not accomplished. It’s easy to give up and just say”forget it”. As you look to the new year ahead you May be making some new lists. Maybe career goals , relationship changes, and of course becoming a healthier , happier you which includes dropping a few pounds. You may be thinking as soon as the new year hits I’ll be at the gym , starting keto , and dropping this last 30 lbs I’ve gained … well stop setting your self up for the unattainable. Not to say you may not actually accomplish this but sometimes the dont’s of New Years resolutions is not making them.!</p>
<p>Think about what makes you happy? When do you feel your best? What do You enjoy and what do You want out of Life?</p>
<p>Weight loss is more than a number on a scale. It can consume us. When we dress in the morning and feel horrible about ourselves when we look in the mirror. Maybe your jeans are too tight or the shirt doesn’t quite button up all the way. This can lead to depression, binge eating, setting unrealistic goals of eating salad for the next week ect.</p>
<p>A few easy steps as we approach the new year with our resolution lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do set realistic goals- start simple. Maybe take the stairs as opposed to the elevator at work to get in a few extra steps and raise that heart rate.</li>
<li>Do swap out take out for a brown bag lunch a few times a week, you’ll save on $ and feel better about your choice.</li>
<li>Don’t set out to workout at unrealistic times … do what you can when you can.</li>
<li>Do cook at home, you’d be surprised how enjoyable it is and you control what’s in your food. There are great apps with no cook recipes and 30 minute meals so no excuses!</li>
<li>Don’t beat yourself up if you slip up. It’s okay to have a bad day. Just refocus and get back on track.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s all about how you want to feel about yourself. Be kind to yourself , love yourself, and treat your body well. It has so much to give when given a little tlc.</p>
<p>All the best for the holidays and the new year to come!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can certain foods take the heat out of inflammation, a condition now linked to a wide range of chronic health problems including heart disease and Alzheimer&rsquo;s? Some headlines suggest combating it is as easy as sipping a daily cup of turmeric tea &ndash; but is it really?&nbsp;Sue Quinninvestigates.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-inflammatory</strong> eating has now been added to an already overladen platter of popular diets. It&rsquo;s an approach that focuses on foods widely claimed&nbsp;to combat a kind of inflammation linked to chronic health problems. Touted as the &lsquo;next big thing&rsquo; by some health and wellbeing websites, anti-inflammatory diets are now the focus of cookbooks and extensive media coverage. The pungent orange spice turmeric, meanwhile, is the current &lsquo;superfood&rsquo; of choice for celebrities because of its widely touted anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The hype surrounding anti-inflammatory foods stems from mounting scientific evidence linking inflammation with a disparate range of health problems including heart disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and rheumatoid arthritis. Many claims are made on the internet and in the media about the curative properties of specific foods including turmeric, tomatoes, olive oil and oily fish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anti-inflammatory diet &ndash; say goodbye to those pains,&rdquo; is the headline on one wellness website. &ldquo;Eating anti-inflammatory foods &ndash; and avoiding inflammatory ones &ndash; can make weight-loss easier, slow down the aging process, and prevent disease,&rdquo; claims another food website. &ldquo;Turmeric&rsquo;s key to disease reversal may be its ability to keep inflammation at bay,&rdquo; says another. Is there any substance to the claims?</p>
<p><strong>What is inflammation?</strong></p>
<p>Prick your finger on a thorn and it might turn red, hot and swollen; this is the immune system triggering the inflammation that contains and repairs damage and infection. &ldquo;Inflammation is normal. We need it and it&rsquo;s self regulating,&rdquo; says Phil Calder, professor of nutritional immunology at the University of Southampton. &ldquo;But there are two types of conditions where inflammation seems to be acting against us instead of with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first, low-grade or &lsquo;silent&rsquo; inflammation, is the kind we often don&rsquo;t notice. Smoking, air pollution, stress, obesity and some foods can all be drivers of this type of inflammation, which is associated with many serious health problems. For example, inflammatory substances in the bloodstream&nbsp;can contribute to the build-up of fatty plaque on artery walls, increasing the risk of heart attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second, high-grade inflammation, occurs in painful and debilitating conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and some types of asthma and gut problems. In these cases, the inflammation releases substances into the bloodstream that cause damage elsewhere in the body. &ldquo;A good example of this is inflammatory bowel disease, the sufferers of which show accelerated bone loss,&rdquo; Prof Calder says.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-resp mobile-grid-100" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Anti-Inflammatory-Foods2.jpg" alt="Anti Inflammatory Foods2" /></p>
<p><strong>Diet and inflammation</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good evidence that certain foods can have an impact on inflammation, according to scientists. And it appears celebrities slurping vats of turmeric tea might be on to something. &ldquo;In studies, <strong>curcumin </strong>(a key substance in turmeric) <strong>showed strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects</strong>. It&rsquo;s been used on patients with conditions involving pain and inflammation,&rdquo; Prof Calder says, but he adds that no robust clinical trials have yet been done and doctors have no idea what the correct intake is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calder says studies also suggest that eating <strong>generous quantities of oily fish</strong> might help people with rheumatoid arthritis, when included in their treatment, because it is rich in omega-3 fatty acids. &ldquo;These give rise to chemicals that switch off inflammation,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;An emerging idea is that inflammation is not only caused by bad triggering [when it happens for no apparent reason], but also when the body is unable to turn the inflammation switch off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For healthy people, an anti-inflammatory diet closely resembles the kind of eating pattern we&rsquo;re all urged to adopt anyway, based on the Mediterranean approach, says Dr Fred Tabung, from the&nbsp;Harvard School of Public Health&rsquo;s Department of Nutrition. &ldquo;Specific dietary items such as wine, coffee, whole fruits and veg and some spices, have some anti-inflammatory effect, while saturated fats, trans-fats and processed/red meat have been shown to have pro-inflammatory properties,&rdquo; he says. <strong>Foods deemed to be anti-inflammatory are those rich in protective antioxidants (which delay or prevent cell damage) and polyphenols</strong> (found in plants with antioxidant properties).</p>
<p>But Dr Tabung warns against eating large quantities of specific foods. &ldquo;My advice is to eat anti-inflammatory foods in moderation as part of an overall balanced diet and not as isolated foods,&rdquo; he says. In any event, avoiding foods that promote inflammation is as valuable as eating those that combat it.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-resp mobile-grid-100" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Anti-Inflammatory-Foods3.jpg" alt="Anti Inflammatory Foods3" /></p>
<p><strong>No magic bullet</strong></p>
<p>The problem for people suffering inflammation-related health issues is that diet isn&rsquo;t the entire cure because inflammation isn&rsquo;t the only contributing factor. What&rsquo;s more, we all process nutrients differently, so what might ease inflammation in one person might have little effect in another.</p>
<p>Registered dietitian&nbsp;Gaynor Bussell&nbsp;says it&rsquo;s now believed our gut bacteria can affect how well we absorb nutrients, including anti-inflammatory compounds. &ldquo;Poor gut micro-flora might influence how these are processed once they get into the body,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But generally, keeping your weight down is one of the best anti-inflammatory things you can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line</strong></p>
<p>For some inflammation-related conditions, there&rsquo;s good evidence that certain foods might be helpful as part of the treatment. For healthy people, it&rsquo;s better to adopt a Mediterranean approach rather than eating large quantities of anti-inflammatory foods &ndash; and avoiding foods that cause inflammation is a crucial part of the equation. That cup of turmeric tea is unlikely to be the whole solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Including anti-inflammatory foods in moderation, as part of an overall balanced diet, is the approach recommended by the Harvard School of Public Health. Anti-inflammatory foods include&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Nuts such as almonds, walnuts and pistachios</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines</li>
<li>Green leafy vegetables, such as spinach and cabbage</li>
<li>Tomatoes</li>
<li>Fruit high in polyphenols, such as strawberries, blueberries, cherries, red grapes and oranges</li>
<li>Spices such as turmeric and ginger</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kale is one of the most nutrient leafy vegetables to be consumed these days. Besides its rich green color, Kale is full of minerals and vitamins (Vit A, C, E and K), is low in calories, fat free and has phytochemicals called lutein and zeaxanthin.</p>
<p>Kale has been linked with a low ris</p>
<p>k of cancer, osteoporosis, eyes and heart diseases. Kale is enriched with Vit K that helps to maintain strong bones especially in women who are more at risk to bone degeneration.</p>
<p><strong>kale</strong><br />
  Kale is easily available at the grocery stores or at farmers market with other greens and the best time to buy kale is during winter or early spring. Look for a bunch of kale that is deeply colored and has firm and hardy stems. Avoid picking kale that is yellow, brown or wilted.&nbsp;<br />
  To store kale, try wrapping it in a moist paper towel/cloth to increase its shelf life. Unwashed Kale can also be stored in a crisper in the fridge for up to 1 week. Usually the flavors of kale become stronger after 5 days so try and consume it before that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>These foods were selected based on two factors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first was that they must be full of nutrients like vitamins and antioxidants for your health.</li>
<li>The second is that they must be under 100 calories per 1 cup serving.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Apples</h4>
<p>Apples are one of the healthiest fruits on the planet, containing antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and even pectin (which has been shown to reduce hunger).<br />
  Eating an apple can be a great snack between lunch and dinner, because it will keep the body full while providing a small energy boost.</p>
<h4>Broccoli</h4>
<p>Broccoli is a super food with the ability to lower the risk of cancer, raise vitamin D, C and K, provide healthy fiber, and it even contains a small amount of protein.</p>
<p>Note* Taking Vitamin D is very important, because over 75% of people are deficient. The best brand is Naturewise, which produces the highest quality organic non-GMO vitamin D supplement on the market today.</p>
<p>Broccoli also provides the unique benefits of lowering inflammation, helping with stress, and detoxifying the body. Broccoli is best cooked steamed, blanched, or roasted and can be paired with a variety of foods!</p>
<h4>Asparagus</h4>
<p>Asparagus is the third of our zero calorie foods, is often paired with a variety of foods, and has significant health benefits.</p>
<p>Containing high amounts of vitamin K, folate, copper, fiber, and vitamin B1, it is a nutrient dense food with powerful health benefits.<br />
  Grilling and steaming asparagus are popular options, but it can also be added raw to a salad</p>
<h4>Watermelon</h4>
<p>Watermelon is a delicious, low-calorie treat that can be enjoyed without the guilt.</p>
<p>Not only is it naturally sweet, but it contains many antioxidants and is low in calories. &nbsp;Make sure that 1 or 2 cups worth doesn&rsquo;t turn into a dozen. A strategic way to eat watermelon is to save it for after your dinner for a healthy dessert.</p>
<h4>
  Cucumber</h4>
<p>Cucumbers are a delicious nutrient powerhouse. &nbsp;They contains polyphenols that reduce the rates of cancer and can help manage stress levels, because they contain multiple B vitamins (B1, B5, B7, Biotin). Because cucumbers primarily consist of water and fiber, they also provide support to the body&rsquo;s digestive health.</p>
<p>Throw them on a delicious low-cal salad or enjoy them in a refreshing glass of cucumber water!</p>
<h4>Oranges</h4>
<p>Oranges are known for having lots of vitamin C, fiber, B vitamins, vitamin A, and calcium.</p>
<p>This is another great option if you are at work or just looking for a quick snack to kill your cravings. They have also been shown to lower the rick of heart disease because of their addition of potassium to a diet.<br />
  Eating oranges will help keep a low caloric load for the day and keep you healthy and happy.</p>
<h4>Lemons</h4>
<p>People won&rsquo;t be sitting around the dinner table serving lemons as an appetizer anytime soon, but this food packs a powerful punch and should be added to your healthy meals. They are a great source of vitamin C and do wonders for your liver and digestive system. Add them to any food to zest up the flavor, or squeeze them in a glass of lemon water for a quick detox. Lemons also contain a surplus of antioxidants and virtually no calories.</p>
<h4>Sugar Snap Peas</h4>
<p>These little guys are high in fiber, vitamin A, vitamin K, vitamin B, and many other minerals the body needs.<br />
  If making a healthy stir fry or are looking to try a new healthy snack, give them a try! Cook them in the oven or on the stove, and add a little salt to flavor!</p>
<h4>Tomatoes</h4>
<p>Tomatoes are #10 on our zero calorie foods, and they are among the most healthy foods on the planet.<br />
  They contain large amounts of vitamin C and other antioxidants, but they are best known for their high concentration of lycopene. Lycopene has been repeatedly shown to fight cancer and ward off heart disease.</p>
<h4>Kale</h4>
<p>There&rsquo;s simply no better way to say it &ndash; eat more kale.<br />
  It is considered one of the most nutrient dense foods on the planet and contains high amounts of vitamin A, vitamin K, vitamin C, antioxidants, and has been shown to lower cholesterol.<br />
  The best ways to consume more kale are through green smoothies, adding them to salads, or with amazing organic kale chips!</p>
<h4>Grapefruits</h4>
<p>Grapefruits are often associated with dieting and have long been promoted as an incredibly healthy breakfast item.<br />
  They are loaded with vitamins and are low in calories, but they really shine from their large amount of anti-aging antioxidants.</p>
<h4>Onions</h4>
<p>Onions are a delicious and flavorful addition to any meal.<br />
  They have been shown to have cardiovascular benefits, support bone tissue, lower inflammation, and lower your risk of certain cancers.<br />
  They can be eaten raw in salads or cooked in a variety of different ways to help with weight loss goals.</p>
<h4>
  Carrots</h4>
<p>Carrots are not normally known for being low in calories, but they are.<br />
  They are known to protect eyesight, but they also have plenty of antioxidants and are a natural diuretic.<br />
  This helps with digestion and keeping the body&rsquo;s natural inflammation in check. Carrots can be added to salads, served cooked with your main dish, or can be used as a stand alone, snack making them an incredibly versatile low-calorie food!</p>
<p>Zucchini This is a great side dish, but it can also make a killer gluten-free substitute for pasta.<br />
  They provide a bountiful source of magnesium, fiber, and folate in your diet.<br />
  They also contain lutein and zeaxanthin, which are powerful phytonutrients that fight off many forms of cancer.</p>
<p>Cauliflower Another great side dish with a similar shape and consistency to broccoli is cauliflower. It provides a great deal of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory benefits from its rich stores of Vitamins K and C.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hunger is our bodies&#8217; way of driving us to find food and eat to stay alive. It is a very powerful human instinct which can compel us to extremes of behavior.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Hunger is our bodies&#8217; response to having eaten less than normal. It is caused by the brain reading changes in the levels of hormones and nutrients in the blood.</p>
<p>It is our reaction to this feeling that can make us overeat or eat the wrong things. So if we understand our hunger, can we control it better?</p>
<h3>Why Do I not feel Full?</h3>
<p><strong>How full we feel is strongly influenced by what we eat. If we do not feel full our brains want to keep searching for food.&nbsp; This is why it is so important to incorporate the right foods into our regular meal plans.&nbsp; The balloon can help achieve a feeling of fullness, making us eat less however it is important to learn about the right choices and why we may choose certain foods over others.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Different types of food we eat affect the brain in various ways. For example, fatty foods trick the brain into believing that you have eaten fewer calories than you actually have, causing you to overeat. This is because fatty foods such as butter and fried foods contain a lot of densely packed energy.</strong></p>
<p>However, other foods give a lasting sense of fullness. Fiber triggers the release of gut hormones that make you feel full. A low fiber diet though, with little or no wholemeal produce or fruit and vegetables, may leave you open to feelings of hunger which can lead to over eating and craving the wrong foods.</p>
<p>Foods with a low GI (glycaemic index) such as nuts, vegetables and beans release energy more slowly than high GI food such as white bread and sugar. Eating more low GI foods will suppress your hunger by increasing levels of gut hormones that help you feel fuller for longer, thus eating more satisfying foods, eating less, eating better, and losing weight.</p>
<h3>Am I eating the Right Foods? </h3>
<p><strong><em>The type of food you eat can make a great deal of difference to how hungry you feel and for how long you feel full.</em></strong> </p>
<p><strong>That&rsquo;s why you may always hear&hellip;. &ldquo;incorporate more whole grains, fiber, fruits, and veggies into your regular eating habits.&rdquo;&nbsp; These categories are critical to losing and maintaining weight loss.</strong></p>
</p>
<h3>Is Your Body Make Up to Blame?</h3>
<p><strong>Two major Hormones which tip the balance between hunger and fullness are leptin and ghrelin.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Leptin (&nbsp;</strong><strong>Good Guy)</strong><strong>is released from the body&#8217;s long term fat stores, which we all have, and&nbsp;</strong>suppresses hunger<strong>&nbsp;while&nbsp;</strong><strong>Ghrelin</strong><strong>&nbsp;( the bad guy)</strong><strong>&nbsp;causes stomach rumblings as a physical reminder to eat.</strong></p>
<p>Obese people have often have built up a resistance to the effects of leptin.&nbsp; Which is why they tend to over eat and choose more of a fatty food diet ect.&nbsp;This is because over a long period their bodies have got used to such high levels diminishing its effect. For an overweight person trying to diet the drop in leptin that accompanies any fall in body fat stores can feel like starving as the reduced leptin levels feel too low.</p>
<h3>Am I a Comfort Eater?</h3>
<p>We are also effected by hormones which influence our appetites.&nbsp; Ever here someone say I eat like crazy when I am stressed?&nbsp; Yes your body is releasing hormones when you are stressed and your body is influenced causing a reaction of overeating or reaching for comfort food.&nbsp; Some hormones affect others differently and you may be influenced to have no appetite at all.</p>
<p>One of those hormones is serotonin which makes you feel happy after eating. Sugary foods produce a quick boost of energy which can elevate mood temporarily.</p>
<p>Food is like a drug, and the same areas of the brain are activated by food as by drug addiction. Food can be strongly linked to social situations such as going out for a meal with friends, so it can be difficult to eat less as this would impact on your social life.</p>
<p>Emotional eating can also be a response to stress. The stress hormone cortisol triggers a craving for foods that give you a fast release of energy &ndash; including sugary and fatty food. Stress hormones encourage fat cells to form which gives the body more space to store fat.</p>
<p>Some people overeat when they are stressed or depressed, but others overeat when they are happy. However, there are huge individual differences, and seasonal changes &ndash; most people eat more in winter.&nbsp; Finding the right balance is critical to losing weight, and keeping it off!</p>
<h3>Good and Bad Habits</h3>
<p><strong>Hunger is caused by a number of factors. The feeling of hunger itself is the result of interactions between the brain and digestive system. But there are ways we can control it.</strong></p>
<p>The context in which you eat is important and habit forming. Eating at regular times can help reduce irresistible feelings of hunger.</p>
<p>Quick diets won&#8217;t make you feel less hungry, but changing habits can help reduce hunger. Make small, long-lasting changes to diet and exercise. Stick to a list when shopping and don&#8217;t shop when stressed or hungry.</p>
<p>Eating smaller portions from smaller plates can also help you eat less while not feeling hungry any quicker. However, breaking bad habits can be psychologically difficult and can trigger a return to poor eating or a worsening of diet.&nbsp; The balloon can assist in helping you eat smaller portions and result in a feeling of fullness faster and staying full longer.&nbsp; This can also help control the hormones like the Leptin and Ghrelin</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robyn Barefoot, RD Registered Dietitian</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard of new trends within the news, media or maybe your neighbor, but do we know the real evidence behind it all? Tune in below to discover science-based evidence behind some of the most popular nutrition trends.</p>
<h4>Coconut Oil</h4>
<p>Within the last few years, coconut has been highlighted as the new &lsquo;super food&rsquo;. We&rsquo;re using it in oil form, finding it as an alternative to dairy milk and eating it on it&rsquo;s own. So, what&rsquo;s with all of the hype? Coconut oil is composed of 87 &ndash; 90 % saturated fatty acids. What does this mean? Saturated fats are naturally present in many foods we eat including high fat milk, cheeses, meats and eggs. We want to choose saturated fats less often has they can be detrimental to our health. Replacing foods that are high in saturated fat with healthier options can lower blood cholesterol levels and improve lipid profiles. The American Heart Association recommends aiming for a dietary pattern that achieves 5% to 6% of calories from saturated fat. The present research suggests that coconut oil does raise HDL (or healthy) cholesterol, but at the same time increases total cholesterol and LDL (lousy or &lsquo;bad&rsquo;) cholesterol levels. Therefore, coconut oil cannot be recommended as an alternative for traditional cooking oils such as canola and vegetable oils regardless of its effect on HDL. In terms of weight management, there is an insufficient amount of evidence to support weight loss in obese populations.</p>
<h4>Foods That &#8220;Burn Belly Fat&#8221;</h4>
<p>As much for us to wish it were true, unfortunately there is no one food to help with tummy fat. The fat that lay in our abdomen is called visceral fat. It lay deep within the abdominal cavity, crowding our organs increasing our risk of chronic conditions. While there are foods that may aide in suppressing appetite (due to fibre and protein content), foods do not have the ability to burn fat &ndash; if they did, wouldn&rsquo;t we all be eating them 24/7? Eating a whole, well-balanced diet filled with variety and limiting sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages can help aide in weight loss which in turn can reduce waist circumference. Typically, these foods that claim to burn belly fat are fish, nuts, milk and cherries. Let&rsquo;s think about this &hellip;these are all whole foods providing many nutritional benefits and eaten in moderation along with a caloric deficit or increased physical activity may alter the scale in a desirable manner but by no means are these foods making their way through your gut and dissipating fat cells.</p>
<h4>Pink Himalayan, Kosher, Rock &amp; Sea Salt</h4>
<p><img class="img-resp img-r mobile-grid-100" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nuitition/sault.png" alt="sault" />Sodium is a mineral found in salt. All types of salt are high in sodium, yes &ndash; even the glorified Himalayan, kosher, rock &amp; sea salt. While sodium is needed by our bodies to control blood pressure, too much can lead to health problems. Unfortunately, all salts (even table salt) effect our blood pressure. Sea salt amongst other salts have just about the same sodium content. The differences include processing, how they taste and their texture. That being said, those who use sea salt and other salts may use less due to the different taste and texture. All in all, salt is hidden in almost everything we eat including canned goods, packaged meals, deli meat, and even healthy choices like bread and milk. Rule of thumb? Don&rsquo;t use the salt shaker &ndash; rely on herbs and spices more often to boost the flavour of your food. Remember: Salt preference is an acquired taste that can be unlearned. It takes about 6-8 weeks to get used to eating food with much lower quantities of salt, but once it&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s actually difficult to eat salty foods.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;Mylk&rsquo; Alternatives</h4>
<p><img class="img-resp img-r mobile-grid-100" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/milk.png" alt="milk" />We&rsquo;ve heard of them all &ndash; almond, cashew, coconut, rice, hemp milk&hellip; last week I came across a &lsquo;mylk&rsquo; made from pea vegetable protein &ndash; sounds appetizing right? So what&rsquo;s the issue?</p>
<ol>
<li>Mylk alternatives, with the exception of soymilk provide 1-2g of protein per serving, as opposed to 8g in traditional cow&rsquo;s milk.</li>
<li>Mylk alternatives do not always offer the calcium and vitamin D.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Mylk alternatives are often sweetened.</li>
</ol>
<p>But &hellip; what about the hormones and antibiotics in dairy milk? To date, Canada has the safest and healthiest milk supply in the world. There are no hormones in Canadian milk. Should cattle be put on antibiotics, they are separated and tagged so that when they are milked, the milk will be dumped and will not enter the Canadian food system. As for American milk, there may be antibiotics however no evidence suggests this is detrimental to our health at present.</p>
<p><strong>What to do?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure the meal or snack you&rsquo;re enjoying has an alternative source of protein if you choose to use these mylk alternatives.</li>
<li>Purchase unsweetened dairy-alternatives.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ensure the mylk you&rsquo;re using is fortified with both calcium and vitamin D.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Sugar is Sugar</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard it all &hellip; cane sugar, rock sugar, date sugar, raw, coconut, agave, honey &ndash; the truth of the matter &ndash; it&rsquo;s all just about the same. Regardless, sugar is a carbohydrate, providing 4g per teaspoon of sugar. If you&rsquo;d like to get technical table sugar is 100% sucrose (that&rsquo;s 50% fructose and 50% glucose), already broken down before it enters the body. In contrast, agave is 75% fructose and 20% glucose, we then have to metabolize this and force our body to break it down further.</p>
<p>The American Heart Association recommends that women get no more than 6 teaspoons of added sugar a day (24 grams), and that men consume no more than 9 teaspoons of added sugar (36 grams). What does this mean? Well, a 355mL can of cola provides 39 grams of sugar, a chocolate bar 26+ grams per serving and just 3 tablespoons of your favourite candy-containing trail mix provides 11g of sugar. Regardless, this can add up quickly. Rule of thumb? Use the sweetener source you prefer. Add it to your unsweetened yogurt or spread onto your toast; just don&rsquo;t add it too generously.</p>
<h4>Apple Cider Vinegar</h4>
<p><img class="img-resp img-r mobile-grid-100" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/apples.png" alt="apples" />We hear these tales such as mixing cider vinegar with water and lemon, chug it back, and not only will your metabolism miraculously increase, but you&rsquo;ll weigh less, have less appetite (probably true because, boy oh boy I couldn&rsquo;t imagine wanting to eat after that potent shot) and boosts energy. Wouldn&rsquo;t all that be nice? Sure it would, but why isn&rsquo;t it necessarily true?</p>
<p>While research is still in the works, only 1 trial concluded that a small weight loss of only 1-2 kg occurred over a 12-week period after consuming 15-30 mL of cider vinegar daily. This statement draws two questions &ndash; 1) Was the weight loss truly caused by the addition of vinegar into the diet, or more so other behaviours changed by the participant throughout this trial? And 2) is it safe or enjoyable to consume cider vinegar on a daily basis? Current research suggests the acidic nature of such vinegar can both irritate and damage tissues such as the esophagus.</p>
<h4>Juice Detoxes and Cleanses</h4>
<p>Dietitians cringe when we see these words &ldquo;teatox&rdquo;, &ldquo;body cleanse&rdquo; etc. Well, we hate to break it to you but our very own organs &ndash; yes our kidneys and liver are constantly cleansing and detoxifying 24 hours a day. For example, let&rsquo;s look up the role of the kidneys. In any resource, you will see that their primary role is to excrete waste and foreign substances from the blood. The liver acts similarly with a role in the detoxification of alcohol through complex pathways via alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Once our liver cells become scarred and destructed, there is no pill, nor cleanse that can reverse this.</p>
<p>I like to say, regardless if a cleanse or detox is a series of juices, supplements etc. and is not sustainable in the long term, is it worth your money, or your while? Probably not. Often these cleanses leave us feeling deprived and while the weight may &lsquo;fall off&rsquo; within a short period of time, it will come back on even faster than it came off. Find a way of eating you can stick with for the rest of your life as you would with a chronic disease. For example, if you have diabetes, you eat to maintain a healthy blood sugar life long. Must I say more?</p>
<h4>Flax, Chia &amp; Hemp</h4>
<p><img class="img-resp img-r mobile-grid-100" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/flax.png" alt="flax" />Bingo! Flax, chia and hemp seeds are great toppings to cereal or yogurt and awesome additions to hummus and smoothies &ndash; they even make a great crust on chicken and fish prior to searing, and yes they&rsquo;re truly healthy. These seeds have been around for ages, yet only making headlines recently. Not only an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, but these seeds provide a significant source of fibre and potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, and folate &ndash; an abundance of vitamins and minerals we need each and every day to maintain good health. Some prefer the texture of hemp over ground flax or chia. Regardless, ensure when using flax seed to grind it before each use for the body to effectively utilize those healthy fats.</p>
<h4>Gluten-Free Diets&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Is gluten-free healthy?</p>
<p><img class="img-resp img-l mobile-grid-100" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hemp.png" alt="hemp" />Sure you can maintain a healthy lifestyle, being careful in the prevention of deficiency, but maintaining a gluten free diet, but it isn&rsquo;t always our best option. These diets take a lot of planning and can be expensive. Gluten-free eating is reserved for clients with a diagnosed condition known as celiac disease &ndash; an autoimmune and genetic disorder causing damage to intestinal mucosa from the exposure to gluten. Gluten can be found in wheat, barley, malt and rye causing maldigestion and malabsorption in these clients and usually results in unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects and weight loss. Should you think you have a gluten sensitivity, consult your family physician prior to eliminating gluten from your diet.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of people ask me the difference between a Registered Dietitian and a Nutritionist. Wished I had a nickel for every time someone asked me that!</p>
<p>The difference between a Registered Dietitian (RD) and a Nutritionist is that RD&rsquo;s are regulated by law and nutritionist are not. The law by Dietitians of Canada states that dietitians must meet legal and professional standards for safe, ethical and quality health care. Registered Dietitian requires a 4 year degree in nutrition or equivalent, an accredited dietetic internship and the license exam called Canadian Dietetic Registration Exam and continue professional development with new research. All Registered Dietitians can call themselves as Nutritionist but not all Nutritionist can call themselves as Dietitians except for Public Health Nutritionists who are regulated by law. Law protects these titles and people using them inappropriately can be fined up to $50,000 (College of Dietitians of Ontario, 2013).</p>
<p>A Nutritionist may or may not have a degree in nutrition, have anywhere between 2 weeks to 6 weeks course in nutrition and call themselves as Nutritionist. Nutritionists are not regulated by any law or regulatory college.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BY PUNYA PURI, RD,CDE Many of my clients ask me if they should purchase organic foods over conventional (non organic) foods.</p>
<p>There is no simple answer to this question. Organic farming is a method where the foods are produced without pesticides, fertilizers, preservatives, antibiotics, genetically modified organisms (GMO&rsquo;s) and growth hormones. But are they more nutritious? There is no evidence or scientific study that supports that organic foods are more nutritious than non organic foods except in phytochemicals- these are natural plant compounds thought to be valuable to health. Phytochemicals tend to affect color and taste but no evidence shows that organic foods taste better than conventional foods. Vitamins like A, B and C are generally the same, more or less in organic foods as compared to non organic foods. The nutritional value of a food depends upon how it is grown, stored, shipped and cooked. In Canada, both organic and non organic foods are grown under strict regulations and need to be approved by Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Buying organic food is a personal choice. What&rsquo;s most important is that you choose a variety of healthy food; fruits and vegetables to maintain a good health. Safety measures such as cleaning and washing, cooking and preserving should be taken both with organic and non organic foods. Since fewer pesticides and preservatives are used in organic foods, it is better to consume them sooner as they tend to spoil easily. Therefore, chose a variety of fruits and vegetables to maintain a good health whether they are organic or non organic. Eat healthy and stay healthy!</p>
